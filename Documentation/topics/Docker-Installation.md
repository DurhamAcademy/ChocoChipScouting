# Docker Installation

In order to run a database, which is necessary to run the website, you must first install Docker. Docker is an application we use which makes it easier to work with databases across different operating systems

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Find the "compose.yaml" file in your code editor
3. Run line 91, `couch-db-setup:`

Great! Now you are ready to start coding.
